As a redditor in Seattle, WA, the city government officials have very proactive in efforts to combat COVID-19 compared to other states in the US, but as a country, we are nowhere near the level of awareness as a whole compared to countries in the east, especially Singapore with their experience with SARS in 2002. 

I hope everyone is safe and sound over there, and this American Redditor is wishing you the best, and we'll get through this.

My parents are heroes.,318,fk1wkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fk1wkw/my_parents_are_heroes/,38,1584463684.0,"Background story:
Msia announced lockdown from 18 March 2020 last night (16 March 2020), giving msians and johorians slightly more than a day to prep for whatever is supposed to happen. Though there are some confusion as to whether or not land travel across the checkpoint is allowed, idk too. 

My dad (sgrean boomer who stays and works in sg, and owns a 5 rm flat here) is the sole breadwinner of a family of 5, before my brother started working recently after being retrenched. He works as a retail executive currently, where his colleague at the place of his employment is a msian boy who currently stays in JB. 

So, said JB boy, one year younger than I am, has no place to go if JB lockdown proceeds, as said JB boy was chased out of his landlord’s place a few weeks back. My dad immediately offered our home to his colleague (whom he treats as his own son imo), our place to stay for the time being. My dad prepped and made plans this morning before heading to work, and was concerned by the sofa bed being too small for his colleague, and then proceeds to ask my mother to get us to bring out the folded matress for his colleague. Me being a jealous brat (jk im not like that ok), questioned how is the queen sized sofa bed not big enough when his two biological sons were sleeping on single beds. Turns out he didnt know how to properly set up the sofa bed (laughs at dad).

My mother even offered to cook dinner for my dad’s colleague, which my dad naturally agreed to. 

My point is, my parents never had much, my parents never stood out. But their simple, small and selfless actions never fail to amaze me. They have my utmost respect for what they have done, albeit small actions, but to their best ability nonetheless. They are heroes to me and i just wanted to share some heartwarming stories amidst this tough period for everyone. 

Stay strong everyone, a little kindness goes a long way. 

#sgunited

Update: My dad just texted to ask if we have extra slippers at home, coincidentally me and my brother share the same slipper size as his colleague wow. We do dad we do, we are millipedes! Do we get to share our clothes too??? Jk okay guys personal hygiene is impt now ok.",2020-03-17 12:48:04

"Shower thought: r/sg is unique in the sense that it's one of the few eponymous Asian subreddits that hasn't been taken over by foreigners (tourists, expats, or online visitors). It is also perhaps the only eponymous Asian sub that was originally founded by expats, but then later conquered by locals.",260,fjxl4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fjxl4o/shower_thought_rsg_is_unique_in_the_sense_that/,182,1584441515.0,"Shower thought of the day. The eponymous subs for Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and a few others are expat-dominated and expat-centric.

r/sg is one of the few Asian subs that is local-centric and local-dominated. The only other local-dominated Asian subs I can think of are Malaysia, Indonesia (where almost everyone speaks Bahasa), and the assorted subs of Southern Asia (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, except Bhutan which is foreign-dominated). The sub for Hong Kong has a high % of locals, but there's usually a ton of expats and foreigners posting in there these days to discuss the ongoing political crisis.

r/sg stands out in particular because it was originally founded by expats, but has now been completely taken over by locals and has become an integral part of the local forumer experience, second only to EDMW. If anything, r/sg > EDMW because it's far less hostile and siao lang than the latter. You can come on here and keep your sanity intact for the most part, whereas one day on EDMW is enough to make you lose all hope for humanity.",2020-03-17 06:38:35

Sec school crush rejected me for an ah beng, now married to a rich man's son.

JC days girl rejected me for a bad boy.

In uni, I got along with a girl in my group really well and there was no sign of her being attached. Then I realized I was friendzoned on the night before my finals when she told me she just patched back with her ex. This one hit me the hardest cos I almost flunked my exams.

Then in working life, every female in my office for all my different jobs are either married or attached.

Tried dating apps like Tinder and CMB, but they either never reply my opener line or just gave excuses not to meet or were totally non responsive. I kinda gave up on that.

I'm a skinny guy so I decided to go to the gym and get a PT, but it seriously costs a lot and the weight gain doesn't last if you can't squeeze in 2 additional large meals or mass gainer on top of your regular meals everyday for the rest of your life.

Malaysia has just announced that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from 18 March to 31 March to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 within Malaysia. 

Given the close proximity between Singapore and Malaysia, many Singaporeans may be concerned about what this will mean for them. 

The Government has been actively working with essential firms such as NTUC Fairprice, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm International to increase our stock of food and essential supplies over the last two months. This means that we are not in danger of running out of food or other supplies brought in by our retailers. 

In addition to building up our inventory of food and essential supplies, we also have in place a robust multi-pronged strategy that will ensure we do not run out of the essentials we require. For example, we have local production capabilities for products such as noodles, infant milk powder and canned goods among others. In the event that we need to increase supply for our domestic consumption, we can ramp up quickly and easily to do so. We have also continued to diversify our sources of essential goods, for example we get a good amount of vegetables from China and even go as far as Australia and Spain to secure our supply of eggs. 

Although we are not facing any shortages, I urge everyone to continue to purchase in a responsible manner and to purchase only what you need. Otherwise, no amount of stockpiling will be sufficient. 

Businesses that employ Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily may have to activate their Business Continuity Plans. If they need assistance, they should contact our economic agencies who stand ready to assist.

We will continue to stay in touch with our Malaysian counterparts as the situation evolves. Our priority is to ensure that our people and our businesses are able to continue with their lives and their livelihoods.

I am aware that many of these new restrictions and announcements may be quite overwhelming for many people. I ask for your continued trust and support as we work hard with all stakeholders to ensure that we get through these short-term challenges together. CCS",2020-03-16 19:42:35

But I want to put a reality check here. That is essentially in our bubble. This is the essence of election in the UK, in the US, in other places. All our friends are telling we are doing a great job, we are doing very well, you know the tide is turning, the people are ready for change. 

You know but when you talk to the man on the street, they frankly have no idea who we are, what we stand for, why should we be in parliament, and I know this for a fact. We had a focus group session and these people have no idea about the opposition.

I even taught a class 2 weeks ago at NUS, in a course run by BH, and these are intelligent NUS students, you know they are communication students, so they are not you know kind of com science, further maths kind of nerdy kind of characters, but they couldn’t name an opposition character beyond Dr Chee, Sylvia or Low. Only 3 and I was teaching the class, of course they included me. Those were the only people in opposition they could name. 

They couldn’t even name anyone else!

And that to me reflects the depoliticisation of our society. See the fact the mass media is dominated by the PAP, every time they open the newspaper they see some minister or opening something or rather, some minister giving away some goodies, some minister giving some speech or rather and so that is a huge challenge for us.",2020-03-17 02:50:06

I have been working in my current company for close to 4 years and recently got approach by a recruitment agency who is helping a big US tech MNC client to fulfill a role which I fit.

Everything sounds good but here is the catch

12-month contract base under the recruitment agency (with chance to renew/ conversion to perm under the US MNC)

Benefit could be lower when comparing contractor vs perm(no bonus/leave lower/healthcare benefit expenses lower)

This opportunity open up a new area where i can be expose to newer ground using this as a stepping stone and with a pay increase of up to 40%

Should i take it up even though it is contract based given how the market situation right now(covid/recession/economic downturn) where job stability is much more important?

She will be sharing the room with my brother when we move. She lived with us in the HDB since I was born to take care of me and my brother. But now since we are 20 and 16, her motive for staying with us is the wifi and aircon. My grandfather has a 1 room flat in bukit timah but without wifi and aircon. That’s why she don’t want to move back. 

What should I do? My grandfather dislikes the idea of having an aircon.",2020-03-17 15:46:12
