what is rational and what is paranoia in these times?,101,fr7euj,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fr7euj/what_is_rational_and_what_is_paranoia_in_these/,42,1585523822.0,"I’ve been feeling outraged at people who treat healthcare worker in a discriminatory way. I felt angry at British landlords evicting NHS workers, or people refusing to sell food to ambulance drivers, etc. Today I felt this sense of righteousness dissipated when faced with threat (real or perceived) of getting COVID.  

This morning, I took a cab where the cab driver told me he had to pick up a minimum no. of clients per day to cover rent. so I felt sorry for him and asked him about how business was - he shared about how he needs the income as he has a son who’s graduated for a year but still unable to find employment, and he’s trying to make money etc. 

At the same time, I noticed he spoke with a very hoarse throat and was coughing. He wasn’t wearing a mask - but that didn’t bother me right away because long driving shifts are uncomfortable. 

A few minutes later, he told me his daughter works in NUH, and that her ward handles 34 COVID patients. rationally, I understood that everyone has their livelihoods to attend to or keep. However, behind this polite conversation, I was panicking and worried about potentially picking the virus up (and passing it on to others, especially my parents). Was intending to wear my mask when I boarded the cab, and felt it was too impolite to put it on after he mentioned his daughter works in NUH, and that she lives with him. 

Nonetheless, I waited for the journey to come to an end and alighted. I rationalised to myself: healthcare workers tend to be the *safest* - because they take extra precautions to be sanitised etc so they will not pose more risks to their patients. And with that, I tried to take my mind off it. Not trying to be a hypochondriac, but right now, my throat and nose feels very warm and heaty - and I hope all the cooling remedies will save me. 

I feel like every decision is somewhat morally ambiguous - should I have taken public transport? should the cab driver have worn a mask? And in this time of uncertainty, I think we tend to see everything through the lens of self-interest, anxiety and suspicion. Every intention can be reduced to “irrational” and “selfish”. While I was not part of the extreme toilet paper hoarding or unethical upselling of masks crowd - I, too, could not nitpick most actions of many. But anyway don’t worry, gonna self-isolate for the next few weeks to be safe...(and only take public transport after that)

EDIT: thank you redditors for your advice and tips; tldr post was about how there is no true objectivity or moral authority *per se* and as flawed as our actions may be on hindsight. we may react slower purely because of habits or patterns of socialisation etc.? i think as long as something is not done out of wilful negligence or against clear advice, please be charitable to the human beings making their trade-offs or decisions everyday",2020-03-30 07:17:02

With the inevitable approach of DORSCON Red impending, the government has already started imposing public measures in order to slow down the rate of the spread of the virus. However, I feel that the lackluster response of the SAF is a cause for concern.

Let me just clarify that as I'm typing this during my lunch break in the cookhouse, I am eating alongside 500 or so personnel congregated within the confines of one roof.

Sure, there has been some measures put into place such as the 1-metre social distancing and daily temperature taking, but what is social distancing if everyone is in close quarters to one another? What is social distancing if everyone shares the same bunks and toilets? What is social distancing if the canteen operator that serves us food and the storeman at the armstoke are the same people that serves every other individual in camp? What is social distancing if men are still crammed together in the same Tonner for training? I think you guys get the point.

I once asked my superiors what would happen in the event that the pandemic does not cease, but only got more serious. Apparently, with accordance to the procedures done in the preceding SARS outbreak, SAF camps will go into lockdown, and all personnel will be confined within their respective camps. The rationale behind this is that is to minimise movement outside of camps in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

Here is the point I want to highlight; isn't there already more than enough people in camps already? Forced attendance in camps have already led to an excess in manpower. Many NSFs just come to camp to zhuobo, so what's the point in keeping everyone in? All it accomplishes is unnecessary exposure to people who do not have to be there in the first place. All it takes is one carrier of the virus to book in, and soon camps around Singapore will become a cesspit for the virus.

""But bro, I last time SARS also kena confined why you complain?"" ""But everyone plays an integral role  in defending the beuracracy of Singapore"" And all like-statements are irrelevant if most of the men in my camp are laying face-up on their bunk beds glued to their phones waiting for further instructions that never comes. If the govt can say that ""people should stay at home unless absolutely necessary"", then who are we as the sons of the same people to be forced to come to camp for the sake of ""serving our duty"". No more than 10 people are allowed to be tgt for social gatherings, but it's ok for twice the amount to be sardine-canned into a shared bunk in between trainings in waves of battalion?

So here are my suggested solutions:

1. Staggered shifts, where men rotate duties in camp to reduce the population density in camp. There will be reduced movement in and out of camps.

2. Community service for the NSFs. Much like the mask packing operation, why not use the men in order to carry out operations islandwide? This services could range from disinfecting of public places, ushering of citizens at crowded public transport interchanges, or assisting to delivery of necessary supplies to needy families affected by SHN. All of these would help to spread-thin the density of the SAF population, all while providing a service to the country in sectors where manpower may be needed. 

Of course, I acknowledge that these hypothetical solutions also pose their problems, which I'm open to discussing in the comments section so as to not make this post too lengthy. At the end of the day, I still feel this is far better than unnecessary exposure to a denser population for military personnel.",2020-03-30 22:38:59
