"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.",8554,a1d71a,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/a1d71a/a_message_to_parents_with_schoolchildren_from_a/,662,1543487795.0,"For context, I'm a 16 year old student who has just completed my O's. I decided to spend my holiday working for a bit of extra pocket money.

The job is simple, we help to sell items for different schools. Having had experience from being a sales girl last year, this was no big deal for me and I cope with the job well. 

I have always been in ""名校"" (what some consider good schools) since I was in primary school, and most parents of the children I knew in those schools were amiable, pleasant people, so I used to refute the stereotype that parents from more elite schools were arrogant. 

My view changed in less than a week of work. I hate to admit it, but most of the difficult parents are those whose children are from the ""good schools"". 

On my first day of work, I had a nasty parent who openly told her son ""You have to wait, she's not smart you know."" simply because I had to confirm that the sample size I gave them was correct with the full time workers at the counter. 

Although I had been briefed, I just wanted to ensure that I provided the correct information and was doing my job properly. It doesn't mean that I'm stupid or dumb. (Besides, if I did something wrong instead of clarifying my doubts, wouldn't I be in even more trouble?) 

For example, let's say Happyland is a really well known school. 
There's Happyland Primary, Happyland Girls School, Happyland High School and Happyland JC. 
The parents of Happyland have the tendency to go into the store and scoff ""Happyland."" when I ask them which school's items they are looking for. Upon asking them which Happyland School they are referring to, they would instantly look offended as if to say ""Don't you know *Happyland*?"" 

The usual condescending tone is expected, but the attitude they give is rather unnecessary. I'm a sales girl and my job is to help you. It won't hurt to give me more details about your child's school so that I can serve you better. 

Some parents would brag about their children to other parents who they know are parents of children who are going to neighbourhood secondary schools, instantly changing their tone and attitude the moment they come into contact with another parents whose child is attending the same school as theirs.

 C'mon, they're just here to buy items for the new school year, not start a whole conversation about how your child is better because their T score is a 270+ 

The parents are nice to me (their tone actually does a 180) when they ask me which school I go to and find out that I've already accepted an offer from a ""good"" JC. 

Are they implying that they're only nice to me the moment they find out that I'm going to a ""better"" school than their child? 

Your child's brand of school doesn't make you any better than others. 

Over the last 5 days, I realised that many of the parents who were nice to me in school were probably nice only because they know I'm at the same level and their child and would like their children to be treated with respect as well.

 It is a common assumption that sales girls are people who have low levels of education and it isn't the highest of job titles, but it doesn't mean that they are subhuman trash. (this applies to everyone with a job people ""look down"" on) 

I know many of you here on reddit would think I'm spoilt and can't take being treated rudely because I'm part of the ""strawberry generation"" and am just being easily offended and triggered by the slightest of things. 

This post isn't about me. It's for the full time working ""aunties"" who have to deal with the attitudes of these people on a daily basis. 

I'm starting to really empathise with those who have to deal with these elitists who think they're better than everyone else simply because of the school their child goes to. And honestly, even as a student from one of such schools, it really isn't that big a deal. You aren't superior. 

I'm not trying to say ""all schools are equal"" and I understand that elite schools exist to separate children of different levels of intelligence so that they can learn better amongst peers that are similar to them.

 I just hope that people treat others with more basic respect, there's no need to turn your child's education into some complex politics. 

Please teach your children to be nice to people, and do it by setting a healthy example. 

Edit: I apologise if my tone is inappropriate or rude. If I get downvoted by a bunch of defensive parents, so be it.

Again. Even more than the last post. Yeah. I said this message in the post, but I think it needs reiteration up here. **DON'T DOX ANYBODY** involved in this post. They did bad things, yep. But that doesn't mean you should manhunt them. They're humans too, okay?

* Also, another point on this edit: Yes, I sent the counter copyright claim to reddit for the OP, haven't gotten *any* sort of response yet, will wait tho. In the meantime, here is the plaintext [Pastebin of the ORIGINAL POST](https://pastebin.com/nZd9SQWN). Still has all the formatting and shit, plus links to whatever images I've got hahaahah. Thanks y'all.

* ***SECOND, MAJOR EDIT:*** I found HOGC's financial info [here](https://www.charities.gov.sg/_layouts/MCYSCPSearch/MCYSCPSearchOrgProfile.aspx?AccountId=MDQ3MDhiYjQtNzk2NS1lMzExLThmZGEtMDA1MDU2YjMwNDg1). You're gonna need Singpass to access it, though, but some interesting notes:

* They spent **more** than they officially received in 2015-16, though that could be down to the move from Singpost Centre to their current location. Indeed, looking at their local expenses, there is one massive SPIKE in that year, comparing to 2014-15 and 2016-17.

* They earned $11 mil in 2016-17 with *barely ANY expenses*, only 500k-ish or so. Whatever happened to the rest of the 11 mil, I dunno.

* They've also got $15 mil in assets in 2016-17 and paid $3 mil to employees that year too. I'm no expert in looking into funds, so somebody help out here.

* Overall, not *as bad* as I expected, but those numbers in 2016-17 raises serious questions, in my personal opinion.

Hey guys. This might not be the best place to post it, but since I posted the original post here, and I want to get the word out, I think here is the only right place to post it. Apologies to the mods in advance if this isn't the right thing to do.

But yeah. Remember my post a few months ago about Heart of God Church, where I *kinda sorta* posted a long-ish report on why they may be commercializing Christianity? (*scam is a bit too strong a term, but it was in the title, so couldn't do shit about editing that*)

Welll....[it got taken down via DMCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8lrm5u/long_post_why_i_think_heart_of_god_church_may_be/).

And, no, [I'm not shitting with you.](https://imgur.com/HEnT0EQ)

And the thing is, I **think** I know why it got taken down. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm confident I know why. And who.

*****

About two weeks ago (*or so*), I received a message from a user called /u/ChegevaRRa asking me to delete said post. I refuse, citing rather obvious reasons. I ask him why, he says he's from Russia and can understand my situation with HOGC. I still say no. And this is where it all gets fucking weird.

Good old /u/ChegevaRRa says he's **IN CONTACT** with several news agencies like The Times and BBC, and says he wants to get the story out. From deleting my message to getting my story out in the blink of an eye, I can tell /u/ChegevaRRa is *clearly bullshitting*. But hey, I do the James Veitch role in playing along. Heck, who knows if /u/ChegevaRRa might be legit. However, he kept insisting, that, for ""**copyright reasons**"", I had to delete my post for BBC to report on it.

I go even so far as to give him a *burner email* for him to contact me, just to see how far he would take it. [He sent me this](https://imgur.com/lFca853), which is probably the saddest attempt at impersonating somebody from the BBC I've ever seen (*and that includes B.B. See*). I mean, dude, a **YAHOO account??**.

About this time, I kinda give up. I actually admired /u/ChegevaRRa's attempt to scam me to delete my post, I honestly did. I told him I saw thru his attempt. Heck, I even *gave him tips* on how to scam slightly better, cause why not? He still insisted it was legit, but I didn't pay attention to all that shit.

Cut to three days ago, [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9oooq5/about_my_article/) gets posted on /r/ModSupport. Someone attempting to **impersonate me**, saying that I wanted to *delete my post*. Fake me goes on to say that the media wanted to use my story and so wants to ask the mods how to *delete my post* in order to give it to the Sun.

I have every right to think this impersonator is /u/ChegevaRRa, given how  the ""British Newspaper wants to claim copyright over my post"" excuse to delete it is brought up once again. Heck, his impersonation of me was *even worse* than his impersonation of a reporter from the BBC. Thankfully, the mods of /r/singapore saw through this and banned fake me. Good on ya, mods.

Which leads to **now**.

*****

My post on Heart of God Church got taken down. Due to '*copyright*'. That post was something **I FUCKING WROTE.** Using *my own pictures* and *my own experiences*. I posted all my sources in the comments wherever I got my own screengrabs. If I ever *did* copy anything, it's a criticism/report of the going-ons behind HOGC and I'm **not earning any money** over a self-post on Reddit. 

And I think good ol' /u/ChegevaRRa is behind this shit. Given his attempts over the last two weeks, I have every reason to think so. Might not 100% be him, because reddit didn't disclose who sent the DMCA takedown, but I'm highly confident its him. Or her. Or it, if a monkey is behind all this. Actually, it might be a monkey. Only monkeys could impersonate a member of the BBC *that badly*.

I'll try to send a counter-notice, which seems difficult given how I could only send it via snail mail, but whatever. I'm posting this here, now, just to let y'all know **why** it got taken down. 

I still hold this stance against HOGC, though I haven't been back there since April. Once again, I feel churches and religious organizations are *sorta okay* as long as they **DON'T COMMERCIALIZE THEIR SHIT** or **promote discrimination**. Makes it difficult for me, as the Catholic Church recently asked to keep 377A, which as a Catholic that supports the repeal, puts me in a bit of a sitch. yeah.

Also, [here's a full imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/D0tJijy) of my convo with ChegevaRRa. You might say I'm a bit too kind in my convo, but I'm like that naturally. Whoever ChegevaRRa is and no matter how much I hate him for attempting to delete my post (and possibly sending the DMCA), **he's still a human**. WHATEVER YOU DO, **DON'T** DOX HIM.

And finally, the HOGC post. It's gone from reddit, but I still have the original thing. I posted a few edits on the OP that are gone now, but I still have the big bulk of it. I couldn't find any *appropriate* place to post it on reddit, for fear of takedown, but no fear. I've posted it to my saviour, **PasteBin**. Don't worry, I posted this on pastebin myself. Though plaintext, it has all the image + their sources I used.

Confession of a petty bus rider,2337,cn5h09,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cn5h09/confession_of_a_petty_bus_rider/,216,1565211558.0,"First and foremost, would like to apologise to the other few passenger who I might have disturbed and highfive to the angmoh dude that tapped my shoulder and gave me a thumbs up before leaving. 

So here's the tea. 

Finished work around 9ish pm. Got up the usual bus I take home. It's a double decker and usually quite empty by this time. The souless and ded AF me went up to the second deck takes a seat at the back intending to nap my migraine away.

The next stop a China lady and her friend came up and sat at the very front of the bus. She was blasting (I shit u not) one of those live Facebook auction shitz. Blasting it at max volume for everyone on the second floor to hear. Worse still the video was in Chinese with a very high pitchy and annoying voice. 

A older lady went to talk to them for Abit to which the China lady just look at her and then ignore. 

I could tell that others were getting annoyed too as more ppl started moving from their original seat, closer to the back. 

So me being super tired and fucking annoyed went to the empty seat behind the two China ladies and sat down. I whipped out my phone and blasted on max volume a deathmetal song I rmb my bro listening to ( physchosocial- slipknot) Mind you Im not a crazy diehard metal fan, im the kind of girl that listen to acoustics so this was the only metal song I have in my phone or knew the name of at least.

Well the ladies looked very fucking annoyed and I just blasted it while looking at them very calmly. I can see her obviously trying to make hers louder but too bad. She turned around a few times with a very pissed expression ( eye roll and all). 


They didn't even last the full song. They immediately left down to the first deck. Not forgetting the eyerolls and stares. 

As soon as they leave, I turn the music off and had a real pleasant trip back home. 

Call me petty or asshole but I just love the expression they have when they hate the very thing they are doing to others. Oh irony. 


Little Info: my bus ride home takes at least 1hour so.no I'm not gonna suffer even half an hour with that shit. Yes I'm selfish in that sense and no I don't regret shit. Kappa

XD

TLDR: got annoyed at two ladies being inconsiderate on the bus by watching FB video on max volume and decided to give them a taste of their own shitty medicine by playing death metal for them.

Edit: erm wow didn't expect the confession/rant post to blow up. Thanks for the medals guys! 

Also few things :ma bad I don't really listen to metal or death metal and all but yea song playing was slipknot. Sry if I made ppl cringe hahaha 

To all those calling me hero and saying I have balls hahahah thanks?? But truth be told I was probably out of my mind (annoyed) that I didn't really care what I was doing. If this happened again, I prob would have back out of the idea hahaha. I had no clue what came over me. Got possessed by something maybe ,🤣🤣(touch wood)

Also to those who say I'm racist and xeno ect. Apologise for having used "" China"" at that point I wrote that was really ranting and annoyed, and really just tryna describe the incident. so ya.  Well I would say they are Chinese lady? Idk that's racist too? Then ladies?* Haha idk but yea. Not tryna stir hate for them or anything so don't get so triggered on me, I have a few good friends from China as well, it's not like I completely avoid them. But yea u have ur views I have mine, I'll leave it at that and wait until u encounter something like this and know how u would feel about it. But if this triggers you, you have the freedom to skip the post downvote whatever.",2019-08-07 16:59:18

Heart of God Church -- An in-depth look into their finances.,2293,aeeulj,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/,407,1547118868.0,"* **KEY EDIT:** Lots of my accounting info here, especially about depreciation and surpluses, are botched, especially some key fundamentals. As I stated, I'm a newbie, so maybe tackling their finances was a **bit too great** of a task for some lowlife like me. However, please check the comments for people that *actually* seem to know their shit, like [this dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edpa9p3/) and [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edpvbu9/) as well, not to mention countless others :--).

Hey y’all. Just letting you know, again, this is a piece on Heart of God Church. What I say is both based on my opinion and my perspective on information I found on the net. I’ve linked screencaps of whatever I found, plus at the end, there’s a link and instructions as to how you can access whatever reports I’ve accessed as well. It’s up to you to have your own perspective on whatever information I present. It’s a free world, after all.

So, yeah. My original post blew up, then got taken down. I posted about the takedown to y’all, which *blew up even more* than the previous post. I just wanted to share my personal experience and what I found was shady in the church, so at least y’all are alert in case HOGC or other organizations try to misuse your faith or trust for a quick buck.

However, for all the stuff I posted, I linked to various sources, but I never had any **concrete** information on all that I posted. I *suspected* that HOGC were taking advantage of people’s faith in God for a profit, but I had no *certainty* that they did. However, now, I am more certain about it, but I’m still *not 100% sure.* Why is that so?

 I found the lovely *Charity Portal,* where HOGC and other charitable organizations post their annual reports for the **public to see.** Getting on the Charity Portal is fairly difficult, though, as if you try the regular login page and use your SingPass, you get redirected to a link that demands you to set up a charity. Yea, I’ve no idea why.

Despite that, I was able to access the Annual Report for the latest financial year of HOGC, 2017-18, and take a look at its published financial details. What I found looked quite suspicious, and given from what other people that have contacted me said about the church, my doubts against the church have been raised even higher. Although this is about as concrete as evidence can get, I still have **more questions than ever.**

Also, a disclaimer: I’m no expert at accounting. I know Assets = Equity + Liabilities and all that, but there are finer details in there I may stumble upon. To some, I may sound like a simpleton, but if I do, it’s just me grasping the basics, trying to make sure I don’t fuck up. If I *do fuck up*, **LET ME KNOW**. Appreciate it.

Anyway, enough intro, let’s get to it.

*****
### Part 1: How much they ACTUALLY give to charity ###

So. From what I can see, charitable organizations have methods of **income** and **expenditure**, like any business, I reckon. In HOGC, this income comes in forms of offerings, tithes and donations towards *funds*, which I’ll get back to later. I suggested in my original post, that HOGC could have a potential to take in *$15 million*. And looking at the [income portion](https://i.imgur.com/RCrDCoT.png) of their Annual Report, they took in $14.6 million from July 2017 to June 2018. Damn I’m accurate.

Also, take note, there are two seperate financial sheets, one for the HOGC **group**, and one for the [**church itself**](https://i.imgur.com/e4n91cU.png). It looks like the one for the church omits any sales done by any ‘subsidiaries’, like their on-site bookstore or ‘Sentinel Tech’, which was straight-up said, [in the report,](https://i.imgur.com/U6zPJoP.png) to meet *HDB and URA requirements* for the lot use for the church. They literally set up that company just to **get the space** needed for HOGC’s ‘Imaginarium’. Ehhhhh, IANAL, so I really don’t know if that is circumventing any law or not. If not, nice loophole exploitation, HOGC. Credit to you for that.


However, the real spice here comes in the **expenditure**. And there are *lots* of things I could raise here. I’ll just focus on one thing for now, though: how much they *actually donate* to charity and the community. And I can tell you, for an organization that takes in $14.6 million, the answer it **not a lot**.

Just looking at their expenditure sheets (that I was only able to capture in [Part One](https://i.imgur.com/oba4ft4.png) and [Part Two](https://i.imgur.com/r1QxVNu.png) respectively), it’s a mess. Soooo many details, soooooo many expenses. But just looking at the numbers on the bottom of Part Two, there’s an immediate problem. HOGC (the group) ran the past year with a surplus of around *$2 million.* Essentially, that’s a $2 million PROFIT. I’m not sure if that is good or bad as to how to judge a charitable organization. Bad in the sense that it is $2 million unspent on worthy causes and kept to oneself, or good for use in the future or to keep the organization afloat? However, seeing how HOGC already had **$14 million** in reserves before the financial year, in my opinion, they didn’t need to take in an extra $2 million. And according to a fellow reddit user that is a member of HOGC, [he **wasn’t notified** about the $2 million that HOGC had in surplus.](https://i.imgur.com/fLIxQQE.png) Oof. But hey. If the money they expended went to charitable causes, that may be justifiable.

Just trying to find out how much they actually donated is tough enough. The financial information sheet on the Charity page seems fairly broken in HOGC’s case, so I’ll forgo that and just look right at the annual report. However, checking out the basics (I mean, motor vehicle expenses sounds *nothing* like a charitable cause), I think I know which expenses are charitable. The “Mission Fund” in Part One and the “Heart Community Services” in Part Two seem to be the two, rather *obvious,* charitable funds. I don’t know if “Love offerings - volunteers” is a charitable fund or not, as it appears they’re giving to the volunteers to do their work. I have no fkn clue about this though. However, with one fund going to towards overseas missions, like to slums in Philippines and all that, and another towards the local community, not a bad look for HOGC so far, right?

However, it *only* tallies up to $330k in expenses. $575k if you include the love offerings. The Charity Portal did put total expenses to charitable causes in the middle at **$454k,** so I’ll use the $454k estimate as a middle ground. And when you look at it, putting $454k into charitable causes does not seem *so bad*. Right? Well, for a church the size of HOGC….*not really*. In total, only **3.6%** of their expenditure went to charitable causes. And remember, they took in more money than they expended. Which means, out of all the money that went in to HOGC, a church, only **3.1%** went to charitable causes.

I repeat, **THREE POINT ONE** percent of all their *income* went to charity. Some might say, not bad, right? For a place of religion, that’s *dreadful*. Let me put it into perspective to show you why.

*****
### Part Two: Putting it into Perspective ###

First, I’ll compare it to another religious institution outside of Christianity. Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho, a Buddhist temple in Waterloo Street, got [$28 million](https://i.imgur.com/oLf5eHj.png) in total income in 2016. They gave away *$15 million* in donations that year. In terms of *total income*, that’s **56%**. And given how they only expended around [$20 million that year,](https://i.imgur.com/yLMeQV3.png) donations accounted for approximately **75%** of their total expenditure. Despite the $8 mil surplus, at least they donated more than half their income and a large majority of their expenses, something you’d expect from a place of religion.

For comparison’s sake, when comparing it to another organization within Christianity, the Methodist Welfare Services, HOGC looks even worse. Most of their income, $23 million, came in from government grants. However, fair to say, most of their expenses went the right way, with roughly *85%* of their expenses going to charitable causes, which in this case is mostly their own care centres. Sure, it’s their *own* care centres, but they’re giving the money to places of care for the community, and it’s a far greater percentage than HOGC were able to cough up. Even more impressive, the Methodist Welfare Services ran a deficit in that year, meaning they spent more than they took in that year.

And even by prosperity gospel-megachurch standards, **3.1% is awful**. New Creation Church, a.k.a the church that [owns and runs the fucking Star Vista and Star Performing Arts Centre](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-creation-churchs-500m-centre-fully-paid-for), is probably the largest of such megachurches in Singapore. So it’s expected that they’d keep a lot of money for themselves. And, with a surplus of [**$33 million**](https://i.imgur.com/OCF9pdZ.png) in 2017, you’d be right. However, judging from their [financial sheet on the Charity Portal](https://i.imgur.com/AwYypMo.png), they still spent 23% of their expenses, or 17% of their income, on charitable causes. Proportion of income-wise, that’s a full **SIX TIMES** more than HOGC, and New Creation still invested in a fucking shopping mall. Jesus, how fucking **big** is New Creation?

Anyway, I’m sidetracking. Heart of God Church gave away only *3.6%* of expenses to charitable causes. According to [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/charitywatch-criteria-methodology), which was set up to independently rank charities in the U.S.A., Heart of God Church would get an ‘F’ grade. Badly. The next grade from F is at 35%, meaning they failed by **thirty fucking percent**. C’mon man. I’m a fucking ang moh, and even I haven’t failed Chinese that badly.

*****

### Part Three: Where’d the Money Go? ###

So, what else did HOGC spend on, if they could only muster up 3.6% of the expenses to charity? Well, quite a lot went into staff payment, around *$3.5 million* worth. With 56 employees, though, that works out to roughly $63,300 for an annual salary there. That’s actually lower than the average Singaporean salary at around $67,000, so at least that bit of finances looks like fair play.

Quite a lot went into operational cost, and I’m not surprised as to why. I mean, each and every service at HOGC is basically a concert, full band playing, gigantic-ass TV screen behind a stage, with lighting effects fancy enough to rival the light show from MBS. For the whole HOGC group, around $500k goes into operational expenses, another $285k on church activities and $233k on Utilities, bringing the total to around $1 million. Honestly not surprised. If they toned down their spectacularness a little and channeled that to worthy causes, they might have doubled their donations to charitable causes, who knows?

Mysteriously, there is one expense covered under the [Church’s expenditures](https://i.imgur.com/c7pTQlw.png) that **ISN’T** covered under the [Group’s expenditures](https://i.imgur.com/oba4ft4.png). That would be *media and music production*, which I know the Church absolutely loves to shove in our face. I don’t know if it’s an accounting error, but if so, it’s a **massive error**, as that expense alone is worth almost *$850k*. Yes, **$850k** that somehow didn’t make it onto the Group’s overall expenditure sheet-thingy. I don’t know if they accounted it *differently* under the group’s expenditure sheet, but that seems really, *really* odd.

Not to mention a good $240k going into *training and leadership*, which I know in HOGC is a big thing. They aim for members of the church to be *leaders*, and as such everyone that wishes to be a leader of some sort has to go through **BMT**. Yes, BMT. Basic *MINISTRY* Training. Hahahahah, [funny joke.](https://youtu.be/6mNcHDrIMQc?t=16) But it’s a real thing in HOGC. Anyone wanting to be a part of a ‘*ministry*’ in HOGC, like ushers, registration, media, bookshop staff, security, playing music, the whole shebang, has to go through this. And, from my friend’s experience in there, BMT feels intense. It’s a big thing. And HOGC makes this training, as well as other leadership activities, a really **big deal**.

However, just looking at the expenditure sheet, there are two *major ways HOGC are losing their money. The first is…**depreciation**???

Again, not an accounting expert here, but from what I’ve looked up elsewhere, depreciation is what happens when an asset **loses value over time**. Like how a new Peugeot would be worth a lot more than an old Peugeot. And I’m talking from experience here, that Peugeot was shitty when it got old. Apparently, in accounting, it’s a major challenge to determine just **how much** an asset depreciated, especially when accounting for an asset’s lifespan. It’s a tricky calculation, yet somehow, HOGC’s calculations raised tons of exclamation marks in their head. Either their assets are *really short term*, or they fucked up in math, or there’s something suspicious behind the calculations...

Apparently, from the [assets they have](https://i.imgur.com/0GqiZSI.png), they feel the depreciation worth to them is a staggering **$3.29 MILLION**. And that’s from $17 million worth in assets. Like fuck me. With that depreciation, it seemed like Heart Of God Church would’ve been *rotting to bits* over the year. But hey, the place still looks all neat and tidy, and it sure doesn’t look like anything in that place has lost value.

What’s more, compared to [Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho temple](https://i.imgur.com/oLf5eHj.png) and [New Creation](https://i.imgur.com/hZOOork.png), both of which I covered earlier and both of which earn *more* in donations and income that Heart Of God Church, HOGC’s depreciation alone is *almost equal* to Kwan Im’s and New Creation’s depreciation **COMBINED**. And both of those places have more assets than HOGC, I think. Heck, New Creation has a motherfucking **shopping mall** in those assets, and the depreciation figure for NCC is still lower that HOGC. I know depreciation is a really difficult term to adjust for in accounting, and who knows, maybe HOGC’s accountants account for depreciation differently when compared to other organizations. But the fact that there is such a *crazy amount of depreciation* within HOGC, which appears to be a well-maintained church that has a crazy-modern look and feel to it, raises one significant question.

What exactly in HOGC is **depreciating** so much? Looking at the assets they have earlier, they judge that they’ve lost tons of value in their plant and equipment assets. But seriously, just looking at the quality of the place, it doesn’t look like these assets have dropped much value. And yet the accounts purport these assets depreciated by **half their value**. Depreciation is a really grey area in accounting, as far as I could see, but goddamn, I’m really uncomfortable about that fucking depreciation figure. Again, disclaimer for this bit, I am not an accountant. Someone really help me, because that depreciation figure seems…*out of place*.

As for the second bit…

*****
### Part Four: The Building Fund ###

The second major expense I found is the rent of the place. I can see why, they’ve occupied a whole floor in one industrial building, called the ‘Imaginarium’. They’ve built a second, smaller ‘Chapel’ atop the building where the Imaginarium is, for stuff like weddings, their childcare and ministry meetings, among others. And, finally, they have an office in the *building next door* that I remember going to, probably used for training programmes or as an open space for meetings or whatever not. All this space taken up in these buildings would obviously cost quite a bit of rent, and this is where the Building Fund steps in.

The Building Fund season is mad in HOGC, where the pastors would **heavily encourage** members of HOGC to pledge to donate however much money they could to the church. And, according to [another redditor’s experience](https://i.imgur.com/WOYIrGS.png), building fund donations could reach **CRAZY** levels. Secondary school students could donate $800. Some poly/JC students donate $1.2k. Some, not all, but some working adults have been known to donate **$10k** to the Church in this time. I’ve heard about similar crazy donations in my time there, where members would do nothing but focus on giving their money to the church. It’s really bizarre.

So. The rent HOGC has to pay is worth $2.3 million. The total amount added to the building fund over 2017-18 was **$6.8 million**. Granted, that’s nowhere near [New Creation’s nutso building fund](https://i.imgur.com/T7o0UhG.png), but for a church of 3000-ish members, $6.8 million is a goddamn fortune. And it’s well over the $2.3 million required to pay the rent, and the leftovers can definitely cover the repairs, maintenance and other building fund expenses. So what of the *$4.5 million* left over, once the rent is all paid for?

Well…

[They kept it.](https://i.imgur.com/CgDMJde.png).

The building fund kept around $4 million, which can be seen in the assets section of the financial information, where the cash assets increased by around $4 million as well. Of course, this increase is almost balanced out by the depreciation of assets, but still. They have **more than enough cash** to cover the rent, so why is it staying still in the building fund? Instead of being used...y’know, for a good cause?

Not to mention that the footnote describes how whatever is in the building fund could be used to inject capital into **subsidiary companies** within the HOGC group, like Sentinel Tech, their bookstore, or their music production. Ehhhh...really? Personally, I find that shady enough, but form your own opinion on that.

*****

### Part Five: Final Thoughts ###

Honestly, going into this, I **wanted** to be pleasantly surprised by Heart of God Church. I really wanted to. I always have a hope that people aren’t evil. Everyone has a good side, I’m sure of it. And I hoped that HOGC, when it came down to the real financials, would surprise me.

Instead, what a fucking letdown. I’m not angry. I just feel disappointed, Heart of God Church. Only 3.1% of donations and other income to charitable causes. The rest wasted on rent, lavish operational fees, toit musical production and whatever the **FUCK** kind of *depreciation* that is in your church. Only thing I noticed depreciating in that church is the moral standards of the pastors and whoever else is running that place, reaching out to fucking **youths** for whatever crazy building fund you’ve got (*that is already more than enough*) and resorting to goddamn *astroturfing* to try and keep some form of name value on the internet. Woah, okay, sorry for exploding in that last sentence, got a bit carried away.

I really want to forgive y’all, Heart of God Church. But first, you have to do better. Cut the lavishness. Cut the excess. Don’t encourage crazy amounts of donations or pledges from anyone. Especially youth. Do more acts of charity and contribute more to the community. Reach out to the needy. And *be honest*. *Y’all don’t run a business,* y’all run a church. And as a church, you’re in a position where you could do so much good, where you could do so much work for the needy, and give some hope into their lives. **DO. THAT.**

*****

For anyone that wants a look at the financials themselves, there’s two ways. First way is to [follow this imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/RrooC5a) to an album, where I uploaded screencaps of the annual report of HOGC, some financials of New Creation and Kwan Im and screencaps of anonymous redditor's PMs, just for evidence’s sake. However, I couldn’t screencap the *full reports*, which is why I recommend you [**follow this link**](https://www.charities.gov.sg/_layouts/MCYSCPSearch/MCYSCPSearchOrgProfile.aspx?AccountId=MDQ3MDhiYjQtNzk2NS1lMzExLThmZGEtMDA1MDU2YjMwNDg1) that takes you to Heart of God Church’s organization page on the Charity Portal. **DON’T** click Login first, that will get you lost. Instead, click on “Annual Report”, THEN follow the prompt to login via Singpass. Then you should be good to go, and you’re free to search the other organizations’ financials I looked at as well if you want to prove my statements correct or false. As long as you have Singpass, these records are available for the public to see.

Again, please let me know if I messed up anything in here. I don’t know much about accounting, so if I fucked up somewhere in all that mumbo jumbo, let me know. Also feel free to point out any mistakes I made elsewhere, be it formatting, grammar, factual errors, or excessively liberal use of the word ‘fuck’. **I’m not perfect,** so any and all feedback are welcome. Even if you hate me for what I wrote.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope I haven’t made the day harder for the mods. And remember, don’t be harsh on followers of HOGC. It’s likely they’re hidden from the truth, or are convinced everything isn’t so bad from the people at the top in HOGC. Like anybody out there, support them if they need it. Be good to everyone, ok?

Have a good day y’all.

EDIT: Fixed a few image links

* **EDIT 2:** A *major* edit here, but thanks to the same anonymous redditor that let slip on how much people were paying for the building funds, he directed my attention to [this bit](https://i.imgur.com/K2UiKek.png) of the section under *Financial Information*. This highlights the *benefits* paid to the **Key Management Personnel** of Heart Of God Church, consisting of four members. The anonymous tip believes the four members are the three 'junior pastors', Pastor Garrett, Charleston and Lynette, with another person probably among them. The main two pastors, Pastor How and Lia, seem to be 'above' this executive committee.

* But whatever. The benefits paid out are worth **$492k** in 2018, which can approximate to roughly $10k per month to each member, and that's added **on top** of their already existing '*salary*', whatever it is. This is a *massive* thing, saying that Heart of God Church are willing to spend the *same amount* of money on their Management Committee as they are towards **charitable causes**. That's a bit ridiculous IMO.

EDIT 3: This gets extra spicy. In the 2018 Financial information sheet (NOT THE ANNUAL REPORT, the Financial Info), it seems the owner of Zhaolim Pte. Ltd, the dude that actually owns Zhaolim building where HOGC is located, is [**also a director in Sentinel Tech** (look at note #a)](https://i.imgur.com/I8JbyW0.png). Dude....this raises so many questions in my mind. They're paying rent to the guy who's also a director for their subsidiary company? Like....what even? Pls, need answers...

**EDIT 4:** Guys, /u/ArtStrom has been kind enough to consolidate the 2015-16 and 2017-18 *financial reports* into [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edpvbu9/) down below for ease of use. It's very useful if my imgur album is messed up (which it kinda is) or you have trouble with your Singpass. Thanks.

**EDIT 5:** A *highly suspicious* thing here, where the church [**does not disclose**](https://i.imgur.com/4lknZ7h.png) the renumeration of its' three *highest paid staff*, due to 'confidentiality'. I think, as a charitable organization, it's right that we find out how much their highest paid staff are being paid, and a bit suspicious to hide it **despite** the code requiring such information be disclosed.",2019-01-10 06:14:28

Scoot 2-hour flight became a 5.5-hour flight,2063,dn9276,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/dn9276/scoot_2hour_flight_became_a_55hour_flight/,125,1572092702.0,"I'm not here to complain. I just alighted from my flight Scoot TR632 from Singapore to Hat Yai. 

After 2 hours on the flight, we finally reached Hat Yai. However, due to unforeseen unfavourable weather conditions, we circled around and around in the air waiting for good weather conditions to land. 

After 1.5 hours of circling around in the sky, the weather conditions did not get better and the plane was running low on fuel. The Scoot team then made the decision to stop by Phuket, which was about 20 mins away, for fuel and to wait for weather conditions to get better.

We went to Phuket, waited a bit and went back to Hat Yai.

All these while, the captain of the flight consistently made announcements to assure us and apologise for the inconvenience. The weather conditions is not up to Scoot to decide and I can only imagine how stressful it was for them. 

Unfortunately, there were some grumpy passengers going ""aiya budget airline like that one"" I don't think this has anything to do with Scoot being a budget airline. In fact, I think they handled the situation amazingly. 

I know it isn't much but they also offered us water- which I thought was very considerate!

All in all, huge shout out and kudos to the team on today's TR632 flight!",2019-10-26 08:25:02

To the lady who asked me what I was taking pictures of,2029,cln6i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cln6i4/to_the_lady_who_asked_me_what_i_was_taking/,89,1564891586.0,"You broke my impression of our Singaporean silent judgment glances, the out of hearing gossip and norm to just keep walking and to not stop for anyone and anything.

The mentality of how everything not about me isn’t my business and how everyone takes out their phone to record when something isn’t quite right. 

I never thought I’d be teaching how shutter speed works to a complete stranger at 11pm at night. Yet you came up to me waving for my attention in my peripheral vision and to be honest, my immediate thought was,

“Oh, what is she doing, is she really going to tell me off?”

But no, you told me that you would’ve never considered looking down the bridge to see how pretty the stop and go rush of car headlights on the road if it weren’t for “this guy taking pictures”.

You told me about your experience when you were trying to take pictures of the Northern Lights by yourself and it turned out looking off. 

You then shared with me how difficult it was to actually take the photo while being inside the picture and how lucky you were to have photographers on the trip with you to help take them.

You asked about why I was taking pictures on the right side of the road instead of the left and I shared with you my thought process about contrasting a stopped bus and moving cars. 

I also explained to you about how long exposure worked and why it was hard to do so and you listened contently. 

You even told me about how your mom told you about the National Day rehearsal fireworks that you went to watch today and shared with me a video from a pretty cool location. 

You said that my pictures were good and I was more than happy to thank you for being interested.

I even told you that I wasn’t superstitious when you mentioned that it was the month of the Hungry Ghost Festival.

I never asked your name but you have no idea how whole I felt to talk to someone I barely knew who was curious about something I was doing. 

There was no preformed opinion, no mindless assumption. Just pure genuine curiosity.  

Thank you for being curious to ask, it was a pleasure to talk to someone like you. 

I hope I meet more people like you.

Here's the picture I took after she left, on the left side of the road!

Edit: Just because I feel like a lot of people are getting some ideas in their head, I am a poly student and this lady was around 40-50. I am not “falling in love” with her and I don’t have any intention to seek her out.

I wrote and shared this because I thought that this encounter was refreshing and it was such a big step from your average “mind your own business” attitude that I think most Singaporeans have. 

I just want to encourage more people to be more receptive of these interactions, it doesn’t take a lot to smile and be kind.

Also yes, this was taken at the overhead bridge at King Albert Park.",2019-08-04 00:06:26
